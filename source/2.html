<p>In last chapter, we've worked out the HTML template without mentioning the CSS. Actually CSS will not be included in this tutorial. This chapter, about the real JavaScript, will be a long travel. Tie yourself tightly.</p>

<h2>JavaScript Syntax Basics</h2>

<p>Simplest examples here:</p>

<pre><code>
// Defining variables
var num = 42; // To define a number, whatever float or integer
var numFloat = 42.0; // Will automatically be converted to integer
var a2e5 = 2e5; // As same as: var a2e5 = 200000;
var str = "Don't you love me baby"; // It's a string
var myArray = [ 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 11, "Fibonacci", "series" ]; // It's an array
	// An array may contain all types of data
var some; // It's `undefined` before you assign a value
// If you want to read a variable before it's created, you gel `null`

// Operatings
var sum = num + 15; // Like every language
var sum = num+15; // Spaces or not doesn't matter
var arthur = 450 + " at least"; // The value is "450 at least"
var arthur = 12 + 450 + " at least"; // The value is "12450 at least"
var arthur = (12 + 450) + " at least"; // The value is "462 at least", sinceÂ we changed priority
	// Guess what do you get if you var arthur = 12 - 450 + " at least";
